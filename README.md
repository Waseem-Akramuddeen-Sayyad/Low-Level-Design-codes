 BoxStorage Design LLD

Overview
This java program models a storage management system for optimising profitability by making decisions about which boxes to store. It evaluates whether new boxes should be accepted based on the rent per unit area compared to the median rent value of the past Historical data. The goal is to ensure that only boxes with higher rent per unit than the median are stored, maximising the store's profit..
