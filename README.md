# BoxStorage Design LLD

## Overview
This Java program models a storage management system for optimizing profitability by making decisions about which boxes to store. It evaluates whether new boxes should be accepted based on the rent per unit area compared to the median rent value of the past historical data.

The goal is to ensure that only boxes with higher rent per unit than the median are stored, maximizing the store's profit.

## Files
- **BoxStoreCode.java**: Contains the implementation of the `Boxstorage` and `Box` classes, along with the main function that drives the program.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the usage and logic of the program.

## Usage
To run the program, compile the `BoxStoreCode.java` file using a Java compiler.
